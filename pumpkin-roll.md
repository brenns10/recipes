Pumpkin Roll
============

Ingredients
-----------

- 3 eggs
- 1 cup sugar
- 2/3 cup pumpkin
- 3/4 cup flour
- 1 tsp baking soda
- 1/2 tsp cinnamon
- 8 oz cream cheese, softened
- 1 cup powdered sugar
- 2 tbsp butter, softened
- 1 tsp vanilla
- 1 cup pecans, chopped

Steps
-----

1. Grease a 15x10x1" jellyroll pan, and line it with wax paper. Grease and flour
   the wax paper.
2. Beat eggs and 1 cup sugar at medium speed of an electric mixer. Add pumpkin,
   flour, soda, and cinnamon, mix well.
3. Spread batter into pan. Bake at 375F for 15 minutes.
4. Sift 3 to 4 tbsp powdered sugar into a rectangle on a dish towel. Loosen the
   cake from the pan, and flip it from the pan onto the dish towel. Carefully
   peel the wax paper off, and then roll the cake and towel together. Place it
   seam side down on a cooling rack. Let it cool completely.
5. Beat cream cheese, 1 cup powdered sugar, butter, and vanilla until well
   blended. Unroll cake. Spread cake with the cream cheese icing. Sprinkle with
   pecans. Carefully re-roll the cake (without the towel). Place the cake seam
   side down on a serving plate. Sprinkle with powdered sugar.

Notes
-----

A Thanksgiving classic in my family. You want to make sure that the cake doesn't
cook too long, because that leads to a dry cake which will crack when you roll
and unroll.

You can use the sprinkled powdered sugar to cover up any parts of the cake that
peeled off when you unstuck it from the towel (which is likely). You can also
try using powdered sugar on the inside of the cake before rolling, to help avoid
sticking.

Pasta Dough
===========

Ingredients
-----------

- 1 cup flour
- 1 egg
- 1 pinch salt
- 2 tbsp water (roughly)

Steps
-----

1. Put flour, egg, and salt into food processor and mix. Then gradually add
   water until the dough comes together and forms a ball. Let it spin around the
   mixer about 30 times in quick succession.
2. Wrap in plastic and refridgerate at least an hour, up to 36 hours. This is
   necessary to allow the dough to toughen up a bit before flattening and
   forming it.
3. Flatten the dough (rolling pin, pasta maker, or something else). Then shape
   the sheets (knife, pasta maker, or something else). Use lots of flour as you
   work with the dough to prevent stickiness. Be especially careful to use flour
   as you shape the dough, so that strands of pasta do not stick while shaping.
4. Bring a large pot of water to a boil. Add the pasta, boil for 3 minutes, and
   then strain. Use as directed with a recipe or however you'd like really.

Notes
-----

Seriously, be careful about pasta strands sticking together!

These are excellent with homemade noodles and homemade Sunday sauce.

Eggnog
======

*I'm pretty sure this is from allrecipes.com, but I wrote it down to save it.*

Ingredients
-----------

- 12 egg yolks
- 1 lb sugar (2 and 1/4 cups)
- 1 qt milk (whole)
- 1 qt heavy cream (aww yeah), lightly whipped
- 1 liter spiced rum!
- 1 tsp (or just a bunch) of vanilla

Steps
-----

1. Beat the yolks together, and slowly add sugar. Beat until the mixture
   thickens. Stir in the milk and rum. Pour into jug or punch bowl and chill for
   a few hours.
2. Lightly whip the cream and fold it in before serving. You can also whip the
   egg whites to serve a similar purpose if you don't want to use cream.
3. Garnish with nutmeg

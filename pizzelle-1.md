Pizzelles (1)
=============

Ingredients
-----------

- 1 3/4 cups flour
- 2 tsp baking powder
- 3 eggs
- 3/4 c sugar
- 1/2 butter, melted
- 1 tbsp vanilla, anise, or almond extract

Steps
-----

1. Beat eggs or a minute or so. Add melted butter and vanilla, beat only as much
   as you need to mix together. Add baking soda and mix, then flour. Try not to
   overmix.
2. Follow instructions on pizzelle press. You may need to grease your press. I
   use a tablespoon to drop batter onto the press, but you may be better off
   with a cookie scoop since it sticks to the spoon.

Notes
-----

This is quick to mix but takes a lot of time and attention to cook.

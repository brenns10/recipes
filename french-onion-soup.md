French Onion Soup
=================

*I think this is actually from foodnetwork.com*

Ingredients
-----------

- 1 stick butter
- 4 or 5 large onions, sliced
- 2 cloves garlic (pressed or sliced)
- 2 bay leaves
- 2 sprigs fresh thyme
- half bottle of red wine
- 3 tbsp flour
- 2 qts beef broth
- 1 baguette
- 1/2 lb grated gruyere cheese
- salt and pepper to taste

Steps
-----

1. Melt the stick of butter in a large pot, then add onions, garlic, bay leaves,
   and thyme. Onions should be cut in half and then sliced thin, so that they
   form long strands. Cook the onions until they are nearly carmelized. Be
   patient.
2. Add the half bottle of wine and simmer that until it reduces and the onions
   start to get a bit dry.
3. Discard bay leaves and the thyme sprigs.
4. Coat the onions in the flour. The original recipe says to cook for 10 minutes
   to get rid of the "raw flour flavor". I've never noticed that flavor, but
   it's not a bad thing to give it a while, so long as nothing starts burning.
5. Add beef broth. I typically use "better than bullion". Bring to a boil, then
   simmer for about 10 minutes.
6. Slice and toast the baguette. Ladle the soup into bowls, add the toasted
   baguettes, and cover with a generous amount of gruyere (no really, you need a
   lot). Broil the bowls for 2 or 3 minutes, or however long it takes to get
   nice and melty. Be careful, broiling too long == very bad.

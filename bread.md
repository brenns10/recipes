Bread
=====

Ingredients
-----------

- 2 cups milk
- half stick butter (or a bit more...), sliced in chunks and softened
- 1/4 cup sugar
- 1 tbsp yeast
- 1 tbsp salt
- 2 eggs (1 for the dough, one for egg washing)
- 5-6 cups flour (eyeball it)

Steps
-----

1. Toss the milk (and, optionally, the sliced butter) into the microwave for 3
   minutes. Put it into the Kitchen Aid (or whatever other knockoff stand mixer
   you have).
2. Add sugar, salt, and an egg. Use a kitchen thermometer to check the
   temperature of the mixture. You need it to be less than 120F to avoid killing
   the yeast. But you'll need the temperature to be around 105-110F to activate
   the yeast. Once the mixture is the right temperature, add the yeast. Let it
   sit for a few minutes to make sure it gets nice and active.
3. Add flour one cup at a time. You want the dough to form a ball and clean the
   sides of the bowl. Generally, I prefer the dough to not be sticky to the
   touch.
4. Let the dough rise an hour.
5. On a large, clean, floured surface (I like a "silpat" or equivalent silicone
   mat), divide the dough into 4 pieces. Roll each piece into a strand, and
   braid the strands together.
6. Whisk the egg and wash the braided loaf with some of it. Let the loaf rise
   for another hour.
7. Brush more egg onto the loaf. Bake at 350F for 28 minutes (ish). A good
   internal temperature for the bread is 200. You want a nice golden brown on
   the top.

Notes
-----

Old timey recipes would have you boil the milk and cool it until it's just the
right temperature for the yeast. Now it's much easier to just use the microwave.

Use parchment paper to avoid the egg burning onto your nice baking sheet.

Braiding is fun, but confusing at first. Check out
[this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RP6j7esQyjk) Youtube video for
instructions on braiding a 4-strand loaf. You could also have fun with it and
braid it some other way.

You also don't *have* to braid the loaf - this recipe fills two bread pans
nicely. Use parchment paper so that it comes out easily.

Variations
----------

You can make a dessert loaf by adding another egg and some additional sugar,
along with raisins and chocolate chips.

During christmas time, the easy availability of eggnog makes the recipe
laughably easy. Simply replace the milk, butter, sugar, egg, and salt with 2
cups of eggnog. That's right - simply heat the eggnog, add yeast, and then add
flour. You'll probably still want the other egg for washing. You'd think that
the eggnog would make the bread taste weird, but usually it's difficult to
detect the eggnog flavor. However, if you do notice it and aren't pleased with
it, I would suggest using eggnog bread with french toast or bread pudding - yum!
